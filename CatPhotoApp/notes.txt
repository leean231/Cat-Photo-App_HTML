<!--
        HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. 
        These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with 
        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
    -->

The <main> element in HTML is used to define the main content of a document. 
It represents the central or primary content of a web page, excluding headers, 
footers, and sidebars. The purpose of the <main> element is to improve the semantic 
structure of a webpage, making it clearer and more meaningful.

<section>  <!--to provide a division-->

<!--The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.
   -a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, 
   so that the link opens in a new tab.
-->

<!--the <figure> element is used to encapsulate any content that 
is referenced from the main content-->

<!--A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption 
to describe the image contained within the figure element.-->

<!--the <em> element is used to emphasize text. 
When text is enclosed within <em> tags, it is typically displayed in italics, 
indicating to the reader that the content should be emphasized in some way.-->

 <!--The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.-->

<!--form = to collect information from users. 
action = The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent-->

<!--You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only
one answer out of multiple options.-->

<!--The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. 
Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.-->

<!--There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute.
 You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users
  select a file from their computer.-->

<!--In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the 
action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it 
a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the 
following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.-->

For example:-
<input type="checkbox" id="loving" name="personality" value="loving" checked>
            <label for="loving">Loving</label>

<!--To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information 
is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. 
There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. 
Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure 
there is space between it and other attributes.-->

<!--In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, 
you need to add the checked attribute to it. 
There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. 
Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is 
space between it and other attributes.-->

<!--Button also have a type elemrnt to indicte what type of button it is-->
